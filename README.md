# FixIt JS

### Your all-purpose website fixer

Have you ever
* run into problems building your website? 
* had issues with float, misaligned DIVs, or misbehaving ULs?
* fought against the rising tide of increasingly complex JavaScript frameworks only to find that you need to learn them in a desperate attempt to validate yourself as a developer to you and your coworkers, but are ultimately reminded that you don't have the time or energy like you did when you were younger to figure out all of these new-fangled design patterns?
* just thought to yourself "Enough with this bullhonky, I just want to be done with front-end!"

Well look no further, friends, for I have the solution for you!

Introducing **FixIt JS**! Your all-purpose website fixer! Never again will you need to worry about aligning elements yourself like some kind of barbaric heathen. Never again will you need to worry about whether your reducer is manipulating state correctly. *Never again* will you need to fight with CSS file orders!

It's simple!

1. Include **FixIt JS** on your page, preferably at the end to prevent collision with any other JavaScript.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="fixIt.min.js"></script>
```

2. Call the fix method.

```javascript
FixIt.fix();
```

3. Watch as all your problems disappear!

The whole process is effectively instant; users won't notice any delay between your horrible mess of a page rendering and **FitIt JS** fixing any and all problems on the page. And clocking in at a speedy 142B (85B minified!), it's guaranteed to download fast even on the worst connections! And if you really need to restore your original page, you can always run `FixIt#unfix` to do just that.

The genius behind its design is in its simplicity: if you don't have any content on your website, there can't possibly be any styling or structure problems!

So break away from the horrors of front-end and just **FixIt**!
